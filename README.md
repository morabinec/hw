# C Programming Projects

Welcome to my C programming projects repository!

This repository contains a collection of small projects that I completed as part of my programming in C class. These projects cover basic syntax, algorithms, and concepts learned during the course.


## Project Structure

Each project is organized into its own directory within the repository. Inside each project directory, you will find the source code files, along with any additional documentation or notes related to the project.

Feel free to explore the projects and examine the code. I hope they provide insight into my progress and understanding of C programming concepts.
